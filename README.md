# Gakucha

A fitness timer that combines timer + taking breaks in-between sets like a stopwatch.

This is nicer than using a timer + stopwatch both when e.g. doing pushups for 20-30 mins.

Easy to lose track of both the break time but also the amount of sets you've done.

# Why login?

I wasn't sure if I'm gonna need to add more things in the future where you can configure things for yourself and personalize it more.

# How to run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

And oh yeah, I'm using Convex + Convex Auth - so you'll need to set that up.
